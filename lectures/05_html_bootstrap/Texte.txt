Scrambled Eggs

Eggs are one of my favorite foods. Here is a recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs
Ingredients

    2 eggs
    1tbs butter
    2tbs cream

Method

    Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium heat
    Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl
    Once butter has melted add cream and eggs
    using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if you ar making an omelette)
    When the eggs are still moist remove from the heat (it will continue to cook on the plate until served)
